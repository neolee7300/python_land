# python_land

First thing first, we will start from building a bootstrap script to setup python enviorment for newbie.  Assuming you are in a bash shell of linux, bash in windows 10, Mac... and you have plenty of space in the directory $PYTHON_ROOT. After running a bash script python_land.bash, the python envorment will be ready for you. 

For experienced users, isn't a script that setups your new computer sweet?

ToDo: 

1. Powershell script to setup python enviorment in windows.
2. Setup the envoriment for normal user who does not possess root password.
3. Python3 only ?
